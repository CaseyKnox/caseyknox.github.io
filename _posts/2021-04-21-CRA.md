title: Threat Detection using CRA and MMWave Phased Array
---
I designed a system with 50 windows computers and 200 Tx and 250 Rx radars operating at millimeter wave frequency to communicate with our software stack over a self-healing mesh network.
Using the data, I generated micro doppler, pointcloud, and range-velocity graphs using fast fourier transform techniques.
After looping the solution into our ROS software stack and mesh network, I displaying the combined data on an Android tablet in real time using Matplotlib.
Final, I performed foreground detection, frame subtraction, and image filtering on the resulting images to detect hidden metallic pipes under clothing using transfer learning on AlexNet.
